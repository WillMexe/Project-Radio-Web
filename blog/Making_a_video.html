                    Making a youtube video for me is a pretty straight forward process
                    and it has stayed the same pretty much since 2018 when i started to 
                    edit my videos more and more differentiating from when i used to just
                    record and upload.
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    When i make videos currently i usually just start recording as for something like my latest video 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0PxaPbhdPc&t=49s"><strong>minecraft on psychadelic drugs</strong></a>.
                    Or i think of a video i think would be fun to make so i record footage and write a loose script to go
                    of of like with the 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TcBT2BF6u8&list=PL0a8CP1inpC9w7yA9v1ULCkD5gsy5f1wl"><strong>Free Edition</strong></a>
                    videos.
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    During the editing process i have 4 stages. First i have the initial editing. This is when i add all effects,
                    text on the screen and all of that. This is also when i cut the video to not be like 4 hours long.
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    The second stage is zooming in and moving the camera around. Putting this in after all the effects makes it much easier
                    to not make the tracking on text or effects look janky when you zoom in as you are just zooming in on the video with
                    the finished effects you don't have to move the effects with the camera which makes the video look nicer in general.
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    The third step is the "judgement" step. This is where i render the video on a lower resolution and framerate 
                    usually 720p 30fps and look through it and take notes. This can range from why in the name of the universe
                    did i think this would be a good idea to yeah thats decent let's keep that. This step usually repeats
                    around 2-4 times before i feel like it is to my standard.
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    The fourth step is the uploading this is when i think of a title and i make the thumbnails. This isn't anything special
                    as any youtuber or content creator in general do this. But i what i want to talk about here is my thumbnail editing. 
                    This has changed alot over time as you can see by looking at my channel and i think my latest design will be the one
                    i'm sticking with. No text, good saturation and one central thing being in this case a mushroom. I think it is better
                    than my other designs as it is pretty eye catching and it doens't need any reading so i'll experiment with it in my comming
                    videos.
