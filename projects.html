                This is my own game engine written in <a href="https://www.python.org/" URL><b>Python</b></a> using
                <a href="https://www.pygame.org/" URL><b>Pygame</b></a> a python library intended for making video games.
                The engine currently lacks alot of features such as lighting and proper collisions but the baseline like a camera,
                saving and loading levels and movement are there and it is taking shape albeit slowly. <br> <br>
                It is planned to be under GNU General Public License but in it's early state it would be to the help of noone to
                release it.
