                    This is my own game engine written in <a href="https://www.python.org/" URL><b>Python</b></a> using
                    <a href="https://www.pygame.org/" URL><b>Pygame</b></a> a python library intended for making video games.
                    The engine currently lacks alot of features such as lighting and proper collisions but the baseline like a camera,
                    saving and loading levels and movement are there and it is taking shape albeit slowly. <br> <br>
                    The engine is licenced under the GNU General Public License and you can find the source code <a href="https://www.github.com/WillMexe/CherryEngine"><strong>Here</strong></a>.

                    This is a little project i made because i'm frankly terrible at studying and epsecially language classes so i made this quick python script to help with my
                    spelling. You can visit it <a href="projects/spellcheck.html"><strong>Here</strong></a> have fun! You can add your own text files at the side as it is mostly for me documentation will probably
                    not be made.
