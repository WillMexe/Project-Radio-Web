                                Separated different uses for different stuff to help with loadtime and this will not make the
                                game look like Yandere Simulator for all the if else statements
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Added an arrested counter. The arrested counter will go up if you touch a military and with this
                                the game will slow down to 80% to give it more feedback. Your screen will also get a red 
                                outline to also give more feedback. This was added since you are breaking into a military facility afterall.

                                Redid all the weapon logic and scripts because i planned to do Melee and Guns in the same script
                                this wouldve looked dodo and it wasnt sustainable. The melee animations were also done in the "WeaponsNormal" script
                                this in another reason it is better to do it in different scripts because now i doesnt have to check everything for
                                the gun logic now it just haves to do the animation. 
                            </li>

                                Ini files are gone crab dance intensifies. Ok what i really mean by this is that the weapons stats system is not gonna
                                be present in this download. I've replaced them with arrays instead but json/ini files are still planned but with the game
                                expanding and needing new variables for the weapons all the time it isnt great. When the weapons feel good and finalized
                                i'll add it back.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Added the katana as suggested by CWEDI like 6 months ago

                            <li>
                                Removed jumping; the jumping mechanic wasnt really used and i had no idea of how to use it in the game. 
                                The only thing it served was confusion that when you jumped twice as high as the walls you couldnt go over them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Added dash. The dash replaces the jump as a avoid strategy. It glides you over in your walking direction and is
                                from testing and my experience more fun to use.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Removed getting op weapons in the beginning. In the earlier builds of the game you start off with way to overpowered gear and that is cool and all 
                                but it didnt really in my opinion work right. I've given the better guns to enemies that you have to kill (this is all wip) and given you 
                                a pistol and a knife to start with. But weapons will be dropped so if you still want to blast your way through a level with an rpg you
                                will need to obtain it first.

                                The map size has been reduced drastically. From the originally planned large maps i've dragged down the size to about two/three screens.
                                This in conjunction with every room now being able to feel more alive because it takes less time to decorate it also makes the enemy ai 
                                much less of a pain to code and now i dont need to implement those tile collisions i talked about in devlog 2.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Added Grass
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Implemented alert levels. Alert levels are levels of alertness. No just kidding, alert levels are to give the player a choice if they want to run 
                                and gun through the entire room with a assault rifle or more carefully go through the level. The alert level goes up if you persay shoot a weapon.
                                it starts at "Low" alert level then if you shoot a pistol it goes up to "Medium" and a rifle it goes up to "High". This i hope will add some strategy
                                so if you have just started out you can be careful and then later in the game you can just blast your way through. Enemy "level" will also increase with
                                the alertness of a room. (this is turned of in the demo below as it is still very buggy)

                                Enemy ai is greatly improved now having pathfinding instead of just a collision line that the enemy moved along if it didnt collide with an obstacle.

                            <li>
                                Changed sprite from zombie to military as it was intended just hadnt gotten around to it.
